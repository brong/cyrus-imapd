Development Process
===================

We need to develop not just for ourselves, but for those who follow us. This
means following good development process to provide transparency,
maintainability and readability to what we're doing.

Making changes
==============

Before you begin
----------------

Found a bug? Got an enhancement? Great!

New Feature considerations: this is an open source project. If your change
isn't a basic part of what is already planned, will you be around to support
it? Can you justify why it's in the best interests of the project to have your
change included? We'd love to talk it through with you: contact us via the
:ref:`mailing lists <feedback-mailing-lists>`.

When you want to submit your change for the core team's consideration, you'll
need to make a GitHub pull request.  Explaining GitHub is out of scope for this
document, but the short version is: Cyrus isn't doing anything weird with its
use of GitHub, and you can file a pull request as usual.  Be sure to note, in
it, the issue number of any issue the pull request will close.

The Cyrus core team reviews new pull requests regularly, but sometimes there's
a bit of a backlog, or things slip through the cracks.  If you haven't heard
back in two weeks, consider contacting us on the ``cyrus-devel`` mailing list.

Community Participation
=======================

Join us! The project is only as good as the sum of its people. We all work
together, despite the tyranny of distance and timezones.

Meetings are currently :ref:`held online via Zoom <feedback-meetings>`.

â€¦and don't forget about the :ref:`mailing lists <support>`.
