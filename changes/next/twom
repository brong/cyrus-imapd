Description:

twom: a new cyrusdb backend


Config changes:

A new backend called 'twom' is added to most of the database engine options
in imapd.conf.  Twom is a database format similar to twoskip, with some
performance improvements.

There's also a new boolean option 'cyrusdb_autoconvert', which - if set to
true, will cause Cyrus to convert the database on first access if the
existing file can be detected (by looking at the first few bytes for file
magic).  This works for skiplist, twoskip and twom source formats.  The
conversions are performed under a global lock, so this can slow the server
down somewhat while the conversions are happening.


Upgrade instructions:

No changes are required if you don't want to switch to twom.  No defaults have
been changed at this time.  If you do want to change, you can optionally set
cyrusdb_autoconvert (otherwise watch the logs for files being opened with the
wrong format and convert them manually), and also update the DB engine for
individual database types.

No issue number.
