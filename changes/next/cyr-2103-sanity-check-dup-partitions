Description:

:cyrusman:`master(8)` now refuses to start when multiple partitions are
configured with the same directory, or a subdirectory thereof.  This
prevents potential store corruption when multiple things each think they
own everything.  :cyrusman:`cyr_info(8)` ``conf-lint`` will report the
invalid partitions.


Documentation:

:cyrusman:`cyr_info(8)`


Config changes:

``*partition-*`` entries in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)` are now checked against
one another.


Upgrade instructions:

Nothing required, unless your configuration was already bad.
